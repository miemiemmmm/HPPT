# Kjera

Welcome to the **Kjera(Kinetic JavaScript Embeds for Reveal.js and molecular Animation)** repository!
This is an experimental repository. The author tried many ways to embed 3D objects/molecules in his 
presentation, however, none of them was satisfactory. The author decided to make his own framework. 

This repository will be work as a template for you to make your own presentation. As demonstrated in 
its name, its uses [Reveal.js]() as a presentation framework and [three.js]() as a 3D engine. There 
are also [3DMol.js]() for molecular visualization. 

You do not have to be an expert in JavaScript to successfully use this template.

HTML/Reveal.js based template for slides presentation

Animation of your molecular dynamics trajectory is on the schedule. But no one knows when the author
will release it.

## Features
It is good to know what you are getting into, so here is a list of JavaScript libraries used in this template:

Github works as the hosting service for all of the resources of the presentation.



## Usage
The indexing of the file is done by the resource (typically files you might request remotely), so you can use the 
same file name for different files in different folders.


1. Copy this repository
2. Change the name of the folder to your presentation name and Push the repository to your own GitHub account (Or fork the repo)
3. If the repository is private while you are working on it, generate an [access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) for this repository
4. Drop your images, molecule, 3D object files in folder. We will index these files by their names(url).
5. 

### Styling and positioning of the elements

### Adding a new slide
Under the "slide_container" (with class as "slides"), adding "section" with "data-state" attribute. 
```
<!--Template page-->
<section data-state="slide_">
    <p class="slide-title">This is a Template Slide for Demonstration</p>
    <div class="slide_content_style1">
        <p>This is a Template Main Context1</p>
        <p>This is a Template Main Context2</p>
        <p>This is a Template Main Context3</p>
    </div
    <p class="reference_style">This is a template reference.</p
</section>
```

### Adding an image or gif animation 

### Gallery 

### Laser pointer

### Embedding a 3D objects

### Embedding a 3D molecule
